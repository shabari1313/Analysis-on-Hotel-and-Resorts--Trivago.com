# 🏨 Trivago Data Analysis Project

## 📘 Overview

This project explores and analyzes hotel data from **Trivago** using Python.
The goal is to uncover insights into hotel pricing trends, customer preferences, and location-based variations through data cleaning, visualization, and analysis.

The notebook demonstrates end-to-end **data science workflow**, including preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building simple predictive models.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform **data cleaning** and handle missing or inconsistent data
* Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify pricing patterns
* Visualize trends in **ratings, price, and location**
* Derive insights to support **data-driven decision making**
* Demonstrate **data science and Python proficiency** for portfolio presentation

## 📊 Key Insights (Example)

* Hotels in major cities tend to have **higher average prices** but also **higher customer ratings**
* Seasonal variations show **price fluctuations** during peak travel periods
* Customer rating correlates **positively** with amenities and brand reputation

*(Replace these with actual findings from your notebook once finalized.)*
